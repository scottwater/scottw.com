Hello this is a brand new [NK65](https://novelkeys.xyz/products/nk65). ~~I am asking for **\$450**. This includes free shipping in the CONUS. Payments can be made via PayPal and/or Venmo.~~ **SOLD**

The board is completely built and is being sold as a bundle.

Included:

- Everything in the original packaging (case, pcb, travel bag, etc.)
- Turquoise Tealios (63.5g)
- GMK Dolch keycaps

I have verified the PCB is 100% operational. I have also lubed the stabs. The keycaps received a deep cleaning before being mounted. All you need to do is plugin your cable and go.

The board has really good RGB backlights and they shine through the Turquoise switches quite well. This board also supports the Via configurator which is my new favorite way to quickly customize your board.

You can email me at nk65@scottw.com with any questions.
