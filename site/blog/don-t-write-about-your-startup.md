Unless your startup targets other startups, writing about yourself is generally counter production.

This is a mistake many (all?) startups make. I am sure we did it on [Kickofflabs][1].

Your (potential) customers are not interested that you crossed the 1K MRR, your new coffee pot, the new SaaS you found to help you manage payroll, etc.

Instead, you should be writing about the market you are serving. Start to tell your story. Be helpful as soon as possible.
