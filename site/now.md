<h1 class="mb-4">What am I up to now?</h1>

My primary activity/responsibility – Raising two great daughters with my fantastic wife.

During _business_ hours, I am the co-founder of [KickoffLabs](https://kickofflabs.com). I focus primarily on the software development side if the business.

At KickoffLabs I am working on improving our "on your page" experience.

For side programming, I am finally building my ideal, the to-do app. I am going to spend some time experimenting with StimulusReflex for the project. The world needs another to-do app like it needs another blog engine, but sometimes you just have to build it.

Keyboards I need to write up:

- ~~Mira SE with Marshmallows on an FR4 plate~~
- SC Alice style with custom PCB
- ~~Austin V2~~
- MGA
- ~~Key65 with inks~~
- J-02 (on the way)
- Sinc 75 + custom case (on the way)

Keyboards (and such) I am looking for:

- Iron165
- KC No. 1/65 (and soon No. 2/65)

I have my eye on:

- ~~Iron180~~
- Forever65
- ~~Sagittarius~~
- Vega
- ~~Dolinger LE~~
- ~~Merisi Sessantacinque~~
- Ava
- Tsukuyomi
- ~~Aurora Input Series 65~~
- ~~Valhalla~~
- ~~Kara~~
- ~~J-02 Rev 1~~
- ~~Adélie~~
- Viktus Styrka
