A couple of weeks ago, I half-jokingly asked on Twitter:

> Any idea why we grandfather pricing and not grandmother? Are grandmothers more OK with change?

[Bryan Marble](https://twitter.com/LostMahbles) was nice enough [to explain](https://twitter.com/LostMahbles/status/1081546155991941121):

> Grandfathering refers to the grandfather clause enacted in the south that stated that you could only vote if your grandfather could, effectively saying that emancipated slaves could never vote. And since no women could vote at the time, couldn't use grandma.

_Legacy Pricing_ feels like a good and clean alternative.
