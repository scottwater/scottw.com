I previously mentioned my best experience with QMK was via ErgoDox EZ's online tool, Oryx. Oryx may be the best online tool, but it is no longer my favorite.

Hello **[Via Configurator](https://caniusevia.com)**.

Via is a desktop tool for configuring your keyboards' firmware (QMK). I had never used it until a couple of days ago, but I have now tried it with three different keyboards (NK65, Rama M10-B, and Rama M60-A). In all three cases, it has been nothing short of amazing. I am blown away by how well it works.

Via's most impressive feature: **no compiling and flashing**. You make a change, and it is working on your keyboard. No need to run a `make` command and then flash your board. No need to compile and watch the baking potato on the screen. ðŸ˜€ It just works!

Support for Via is limited to about 40 different boards. No clue what it takes to go from "regular" QMK to Via compatible, but I hope others can make the journey soon.
