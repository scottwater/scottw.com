This is a KBDFans Tofu 60% keyboard with the HHKB layout (Black). I am asking **\$385** for the board. This includes free shipping in the CONUS. Payments can be made via PayPal or Venmo.

The board is in pristine condition and is being sold as a bundle.

Included:

- The case, PCB, brass weight, and black cable
- Durock screw in stabs, lubed (Dielectric grease) and band-aid modded.
- Smokey gray T1 switches, lubed with Krytox 203 G00.
- GMK Mito Pulse Keycaps

The PCB is 100% operational. I have also replaced and lubed the stabs. This is a huge improvement over what KBDFans ships in the box (zero rattle). The switches have also been recently lubed and sound amazing.

The PCB has 8 LEDs on it, but they are mostly unseen with the current case, keycaps, and switches.

The keyboard can be easily customized using QMK. It will be flashed to the default configuration prior to shipping.

All you have to do is plug it in and begin typing.

You can email me at tofuhhkb@scottw.com with any questions.
