[SourceNote](https://www.sourcenoteapp.com) is a new (to me?) app that makes it really easy to file away a bit of text without interrupting your current work flow.

For most, git provides a great historical perspective of your commits. However, it does lack iterations of code which were never committed.

As the name suggests, it bills itself as a developer tool, but was helpful even as I wrote this post.

At $3.99 it is a bargain.
