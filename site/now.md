# What am I up to now?

My primary activity/responsibility â€“ Raising two great daughters with my fantastic wife.

During _business_ hours, I am the co-founder of [KickoffLabs](https://kickofflabs.com). I focus primarily on the software development side if the business.

At KickoffLabs I am working on:

- E-commerce referrals/rewards (mostly Shopify at this point)
- KickoffLabs API V2
- Simplifying how we manage the product

Outside of Family and KickoffLabs:

- Writing more (I hope!)
- Building [How I VSCode](https://howivscode.com)
- Prototyping a couple of other product ideas (maybe even the successor or evolution of KickoffLabs itself)
- Digging deeper in JavaScript. Especially TypeScript and Svelte
- Doubling down on the boring stack (Rails, Tailwind, Webpack, Stimulus, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Heroku)
