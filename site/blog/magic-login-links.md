I initially liked the idea of magic login links. One less password sounded great. But now, I find they only cause confusion and slow me down, especially in native apps where a password manager may now work. 

I must have half a dozen unused Notion accounts. Did I use my work email? My Gmail? What about my personal email? With notion, in particular, they just create an account for any email you enter. 

Please keep it simple and just let me enter a username and password. If you want to confirm the email after I sign in, go for it (but please don't).
