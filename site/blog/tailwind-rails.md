Setting up [Tailwind][1] (properly) in Rails requires quite a few steps.

Thankfully there is a gem which automates most of them: [Tailwind Rails][2]

Note: There are still a couple of commands you need to execute first (including install webpacker), but it worked perfectly on the first try for me.
