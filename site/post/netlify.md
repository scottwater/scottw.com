[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) is an amazing service. I still find it hard to believe how much they give away for free.

By my rough math (ie, me counting silently to myself) a post goes live in about 10 to 11 seconds after I do a git push.

I still have not had a chance to play with their Functions or Form support yet, but it looks like there is so much more here than just static site hosting.
