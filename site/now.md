<h1 class="mb-4">What am I up to now?</h1>

My primary activity/responsibility â€“ Raising two great daughters with my fantastic wife.

During _business_ hours, I am the co-founder of [KickoffLabs](https://kickofflabs.com). I focus primarily on the software development side if the business.

At KickoffLabs I am working on improving our "on your page" experience.

For side programming, I am finally building my ideal, the to-do app. I am going to spend some time experimenting with StimulusReflex for the project. The world needs another to-do app like it needs another blog engine, but sometimes you just have to build it.

Keyboards I need to write up:

- MGA
- Prime Elise

On the look out for:

- TKL with lower profile than the Mira

I have my eye on:

- Ava
- Forever65
- Iron265
- LZ Phase
- MGA (cyan!)
- Meridian
- No 2/65
- Viktus Styrka
- Yeti
