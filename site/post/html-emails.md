Browsers have made massive improvements over the years. The differences between them are now minor. Standards are supported faster than ever and all he major players push updates regularly.

Unfortunately, HTML in emails is still in the dark ages.

- Tables
- Inline styles
- Limited styles
- A patchwork of build tools
- Testing requires a subscription to Litmus.

One of my goals for the coming year is to get better at design (or at least quicker...). Email design is not something I expected to spend time on.

[Zurb for Emails][1] looks quite promising as do the [these templates][2]. This is a fantastic list of [Awesome Email][3] resources.
