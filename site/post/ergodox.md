I spent a couple of weeks using the [ErgoDox EZ](https://ErgoDox-ez.com) but decided it was not for me.

* The ErgoDox EZ is a well-constructed keyboard.
* The company behind it provides top-notch support (even had the CEO on a thread or two).
* [QMK](https://qmk.fm/) is the real deal. (See, [I do not want a keyboard without it](https://scottw.com/blog/qmk).)
* [Oryx](https://ErgoDox-ez.com/pages/oryx) is fantastic. Oryx is ErgoDox EZ's custom graphical (browser) tool for managing customizations (key mappings, layers, and colors). It is a night and day advantage over the crazy voodoo most other keyboards expect you to go through for customizations.
* The ortholinear layout was too big of a shift for my developer/keyboard short workflow. The deal-breaker  was when I had to do some work directly on my MBP. The context switching between such different layouts was too much and not something I wanted to work through long term.

The experiment cost me some productivity and about $100. However, I learned quite a bit about what I value/want/need from a mechanical keyboard. It also led to a bit more exploration (hint: I bought and tried more keyboards), which I hope to share in a future post or two.
