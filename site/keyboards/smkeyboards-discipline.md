The [Discipline](https://www.cftkb.com/shop/discipline) is a through-hole PCB kit[^kb] by CFTKB and completes my trilogy ([Mysterium](https://scottw.com/keyboards/mysterium/) and [Romeo](https://scottw.com/keyboards/romeo_spring/)[^case]).

For the case, I went with an acrylic case by [SM Keyboards](https://smkeyboards.com/). The case itself is spectacular. I have had a couple of acrylic cases before, and I wanted to change things up a bit. Instead of using an acrylic plate, I went with a custom copper plate.

Overall, this board has been hit or miss.

Positives:

- The case is excellent. I highly recommend purchasing cases from SM Keyboards.
- The copper plate is quite lovely. I love the bits of copper you see between the keycaps.
- GMK Voyage is a perfect match for the blue case highlights. This a happy accident, but it turned out great.

Negatives:

- I am not a big fan of metal plates. In particular, I'm not too fond of the mix of copper and acrylic. Next time I do an acrylic board, it will have a 5mm acrylic plate[^3mm].
- I initially tried Kiwi switches. They were horrible (my preference, of course).
- I switched to NK Creams. I enjoy these more than the Kiwis (well, I prefer linear to tactile), but I do not love them.
- The layout of the Disciple is not my style. A 65% without a blocker is not for me. (more below)

So what to do? Well, I started down the road to sell the board, and eventually I might go this route. I had it listed to sell recently, but did not push it very hard. The other option is to try another layout. The 3x 1.25, 6.25, and 2x 1.5 might suit me better[^sb], but I am not sure I want to do the work at this time.

[^kb]: Technically, you can use it without a case (many do).
[^3mm]: I recently built a board with a 3mm acrylic plate and it is not the same. 5mm for life.
[^sb]: I am not a fan of the spacebar starting at the Z key. With a 1.5u, 1u, 1.5u layout, the spacebar gets pushed between X and C.
[^case]: The Romeo now has a case as well.
