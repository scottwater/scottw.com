I recently rebuilt my site Eleventy.

The process took a bit longer than I hoped, but overall I feel like I am in better shape going forward.

My main reasons for switching from Jekyll were speed and flexibility. 

I am still not 100% done, but I wanted to do more to track and share links I find interesting. I also merged my previous "shorts" and "posts" under one category of blog.
