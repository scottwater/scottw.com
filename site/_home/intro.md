# What is this?

This is the personal site of Scott Watermasysk.

I am a bootstrapped business founder & advocate, ruby on rails developer, husband, father, sometimes basketball coach. I love to build things.

I have worked at startups (we call them small businesses on the east coast) for nearly 20 years. This site is a collection of what I am working on, learning, and find interesting.

Quick life summary:

* I live in New Jersey with three amazing women.
* Graduated from Rutgers
* Spent many years in the .NET/ASP.Net world, but now code almost exclusively in Ruby.
* I believe the world would be better if people spent more time doing creative things (note: creative is much more than just art).
* I drive to many dance classes.
* Software is what I was born to do professionally.
* I love to build stuff and I am trying to get better at shipping and sharing it regularly.
