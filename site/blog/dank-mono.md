I switched[^1] my main programming font last week from Fira Code 2 to [Dank Mono](https://dank.sh).

After a couple of days, I have to say I am enjoying it.

1. The italic crossed with script (cursive) is a nice visual change.
2. Supports ligatures which is now a must have for me.
3. There are two types of developers. Those who love change and those who hate change. Neither are right or wrong, but I am in the love change camp. The small visual update makes everything feel more fresh.

The recommended font-size with it is 14. I had been running Fira Code (which I still love) at 24px. For Dank I switched to 20px and bumped the font-weight up to 500 in Visual Studio Code.
