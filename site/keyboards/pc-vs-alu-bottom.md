This is a quick sound comparison of a PC (polycarbonate) bottom vs an ALU (aluminum) bottom[^bumpons]. The top (alu), plate (FR4), keycaps (GMK/abs) and switches (creamsicles[^loud]) are the same in both.

[^bumpons]: At this time, I only have one set of bumpons which have been placed on the PC bottom.
[^loud]: Creamsicles are Tangerine switches with a NK Cream stem. The NK Cream stem is longer than your typical JWK stem. This causes a much louder sound when you bottom out...especially in a sound test. ;)
