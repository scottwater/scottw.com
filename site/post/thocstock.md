Back in February, I built and released a new site, [ThocStock](https://thocstock.com).

The primary goal of ThocStock is to list custom mechanical keyboard products that are not only of high quality but also in stock.

For those not familiar with the custom mechanical keyboard space, products are scattered across many sites worldwide; availability is often very scarce.

In the first six months, the site has far exceeded my expectations. Like most side projects, it is often not easy to find time to keep them going, but the community's enthusiasm has made it easy to keep updating and enhancing the experience.
