Assuming everything goes according to plan, you should see this message on Monday morning. 

Prior it started in my inbox, hit the iCloud server, was forwarded to Zapier who pinged my server. From my server it was sent to Github who promptly let Netlify know there was something new. Netlify rebuilt my site and eventually Buffer noticed the new content and sent it to Twitter.

A little over complicated? Yes. But still awesome and very useful.
