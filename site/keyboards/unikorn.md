This one is short and sweet. The Unikorn is a spectacular-looking keyboard (and the weight, in particular, is second to none). However, when it comes to typing experience and sound, I found it far behind the Bakeneko60.

As much as I enjoy looking at a nice keyboard, in the end, it is all about the experience of using it, so I quickly sold mine (I had to pay flipper price to buy it on the aftermarket).
