My Prime Elise is (now) in the dark gray colorway. I swapped the Alu bottom for PC. I find a PC top looks a bit cheap and unfinished. However, if you are going to do RGB, it is the only option that works for me.

It is currently built with creamsicles on an FR4 plate. However, I managed to pick up a polypropylene plate in recent trade, so a rebuild is on the horizon.
