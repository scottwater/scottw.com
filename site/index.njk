  <a href="https://kickofflabs.com" aria-label="Read more about KickoffLabs">KickoffLabs</a> -
 I guess a <em>project</em> is a stretch since this is also my livelihood. ðŸ˜€ KickoffLabs is a platform for <strong>growing your business with viral marketing contests</strong>. I have been working on it for about eight years (March 2011), and it is still going strong.
