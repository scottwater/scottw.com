> Too many windows to manage? Large display? Or sometimes getting lost in multiple monitors? HazeOver is for you! This app automatically highlights the front window by fading out all the background windows.

I have been using HazeOver for a couple of days now and works as promised. I find it makes it much easier to focus on the main window I am working on.
