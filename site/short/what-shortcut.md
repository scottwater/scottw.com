I could not figure out why VSCode's shortcut for the command pallet was not working (⌘ + ⇧ + P). (There was another app bound the shortcut.)

How do you find out which app is bound to a specific shortcut?

It turns out there is an excellent (free) app for that [ShortcutDetective](http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/labs/).

You have to enable the accessibility settings, but a couple of seconds later, I found the bugger....Noizio (which is a great app as well).
