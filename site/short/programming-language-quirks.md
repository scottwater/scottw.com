With Ruby, I am generally joyed by the many little language quicks. My reaction is almost always, "hmm...that is kind of nice".

However, when it comes to JavaScript it is generally, "Who the F thought that was a good idea".

Selection bias for sure...but you can not deny one was written for the joy of programming and the other got lucky.
