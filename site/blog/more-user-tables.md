The last post about [Users vs. Customers](https://scottw.com/users-vs-customers) got me thinking about a [tweet](https://twitter.com/lovevalgeisler/status/1058344849689247746) a saw a couple of weeks ago by [Val Geisler](https://twitter.com/lovevalgeisler):

> Drug dealers have users. \*You\* have customers.

This really is the right mindset for a product. I will never have a users table in a product again.
