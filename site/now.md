# What am I up to now?

My primary activity/responsibility â€“ Raising two great daughters with my fantastic wife.

During _business_ hours, I am the co-founder of [KickoffLabs](https://kickofflabs.com). I focus primarily on the software development side if the business.

At KickoffLabs I am working on improving our "on your page" experience.

I am also building a few more keyboards. In the short term:

* Mira SE - I have one PCB and two plates. Trying to decide between tactile switches and a stainless steel plate or linear switches and a FR4 plate (new PCB to do the other will be in the summer).
* Acrylic Alice - I have the board and the switches are lubed. Waiting on a mechlovin PCB.

For a side project, I am working on something fun to help you rank and sort some of your favorite mechanical keyboard items.
