Bug, defects, delays, etc will always happen. With good practices, you can minimize them, but they will always exist.

You can however control **how you respond to them**. This message from [WASD][1] is exceptional.[^1]

![Sorry email from WASD](/assets/images/posts/wasd_sorry.png)

1. Accept fault
2. Apologize
3. Provide details and supporting information.

[^1]: If you are following my [keyboard journey][2], interactions with WASD like this won me over.
