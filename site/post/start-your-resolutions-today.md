It is roughly 34 days to New Years. Add another day or two to recover from the holidays and it is roughly 5 weeks until you decide this is the year you are going to learn something. Build something. Ship something.

Don't wait until the new year. **Start today. Pick something. Make a plan. Start executing.**
