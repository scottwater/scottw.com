This is my first build with Zykos. How they ended up in this board and not the Mira is a longer story.

I enjoy them quite a bit and love the sound. However, there was one part of the sound profile I was not enjoying, so I made a slight modification. I am curious what others may think.

## Original

This was the original build and sound profile.

Something felt a slightly off, so I made a change.

Which did you like better?

*Note, I did changed from regular capslock to stepped, but had nothing to do with the sound change*.
