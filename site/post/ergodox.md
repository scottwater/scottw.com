I have been thoroughly enjoying my [Code keyboard](https://scottw.com/blog/mac-mechanical-keyboard-search/). However, I recently started experience some discomfort typing and took the opportunity to try the [ErgoDox EZ](https://ErgoDox-ez.com).

I was very excited to get started with it. If memory serves me correctly, it was about 3 weeks from the time I ordered it until it was delivered.

The layout of the ErgoDox is quite different than most other keyboards. It has a split design and the keys are laid out Ortholinear (straight lines). Going in, I had done my research and knew that it would take a couple of weeks go get back to my normal typing speed.

First, here is what I really liked:

1. It feels well made. Not as sturdy or heavy as the code, but still solid.
2. Key mappings - I am still a relative newbie in the world of mechanical keyboards, but I am willing to bet there is not another keyboard that is as easy to customize. You make changes using a very easy to navigate GUI tool in your browser. Download the settings and then flash your keyboard using a desktop app.
3. Layers - just about every mechanical keyboard has multiple layers. Some are easier to navigate than others. On most other keyboards, you select a layer, execute your keystrokes, and then go back to your main layer. ErgoDox supports this work flow, but they also have the option to execute keystrokes in a different layer by either holding a specific key or even better executing a single keystroke in another layer. I loved this for navigating spaces on OS X.
4. Support - support was typically quick to respond and the CEO even hopped on one of the threads. You do not see that often, even from small companies.

In the end, I decided it was not for me and found someone who was willing to take it off my hands.

1. I love my keyboard shortcuts. While I was getting faster navigating around the split+Ortholinear layout, I found that even after a couple of weeks the mental hurdle of doing so and using my favorite keyboard shortcuts was too much.
2. I still have times when I need to work directly on a regular keyboard (on the MBP keyboard). I was finding when I would jump back to the MBP keyboard I felt out of place.
3. Dual keys - one of touted features is the concept of a dual keys. You can execute different keystrokes by tapping and holding a single key. This feature worked, but I found I often executed the hold stroke by accident.
4. I never found good locations/flow for brackets and quotes. I initially thought this was due to the limited number of keys, but as I am writing this now on a 60% keyboard, this was most likely on me. For your average user, these are easy to ignore. For someone who primarily writes code for a living, they are as important as any letter or number.

It is also important to point out that I no longer believe the discomfort I was feeling was related was related to the keyboard. I now think it is much more driven by crappy posture and not using both hands for keyboard shortcuts. If you a medical condition that the ErgoDox will help with, I could not recommend it enough.
