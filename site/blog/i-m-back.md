.....well hello there blogging world!

It has been a while, but I am determined to give this a shot again.

Too much content is wasted on places like Twitter and Facebook. It is often hard to read/follow (tweet storms need to die) and even the best content quickly disappears.

I have a simple process set up for writing and a couple of ideas to make quick things on the go more feasible with this Jekyll setup.

I am not even going to set up my actual domain until I have a couple of posts in the queue. So if you are reading this, looks like I am on the right track.
