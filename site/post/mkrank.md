A couple of weeks ago, I built and released a new side project, [MKRank.com](https://mkrank.com).

The goal of MKRank is to allow members of the mechanical keyboard community to rank some of their favorite products.

There were a couple of interesting technical changes I need to write up for this site (SSL, Stimulus.js, Tailwind, and the leaderboards in particular).

From an app perspective, similar to HowIVSCode, I am determined to build this without the need to market to the existing user base continually. I am not collecting emails, no tracking, etc.

Lack of contact information means growth will be slow, but new people are signing up daily, and I have been able to keep adding new content consistently.

If it sticks, it will be a matter of persistence (and not getting bored myself).
