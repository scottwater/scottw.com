I am continually impressed with what can be accomplished with Zapier. It is very polished, has great support, and is an ideal way to link together multiple services. 

Yesterday I was able to help a customer wire up a brand new integration using two simple webhooks.

The first took a webhook from the customer's 'form vendor' sent the data Zapier. The next webhook was from within Zapier and posted back to KickoffLabs. All in, it took less than 10 minutes to set up (and most was trying to figure out how to use the customer's form vendor).
