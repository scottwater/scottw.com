I love the lifestyle and freedom of owning my own business and building things that generally interest me. But I have always said I could give it up in a second and work for mega-corp XYZ[^1] if that was required to take care of my family.

While I firmly believe we have an [obligation](https://scottw.com/obligation) to do interesting things if/when possible, I also believe most people are too risk-adverse (both financially and public opinion) to failure to choose this path. Not to mention the fact that raising a family does not leave a lot of time to build and tinker...let alone publish things for others to use.

However, in the coming years we are going to start seeing a lot of people with the skills and desire to be makers have a change in responsibilities. The children are going to be less financially dependent[^2]. The family time commitments will also likely lessen. And hopefully, many will start to have more financial independence as well.

I wonder if they will see this as their chance to try something new. If they will see as an opportunity to take a chance. Even more interesting would be a rise in bootstrapped businesses. The cost to start a web business continues to plummet. We could have many more skilled workers, with time, desire, and means....might just be the next small business renaissance as well.

[^1]: Yes, not all big companies are bad and there are some good reasons to work for some, especially when you want to be part of something at scale.
[^2]: Very carefully saying less...college, kids moving back, etc. I don't think anyone is off the hook for while.
