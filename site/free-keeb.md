# Do You Know Someone Who Could Use a Free Mechanical Keyboard?

A mechanical keyboard will not make better at your job. However, good tools (like a mechanical keyboard) certainly make doing the work more enjoyable.

My [first mechanical keyboard](https://scottw.com/blog/mac-mechanical-keyboard-search/) ([WASD Code V3 87 Key, MX Brown switches + backlighting](https://www.wasdkeyboards.com/code-v3-87-key-mechanical-keyboard-cherry-mx-brown.html)) has been sitting on a self (and other places) for the better part of the last six months, and it deserves a better home. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it (I have the original cable and keycap puller as well).

I have explored selling it, but it is not moving at a price that makes it worth the effort.

For 2020 I have set “Build Bridges, not Walls” as a goal. This is 100% unmeasurable, but helping someone enjoy their work a bit feels like an excellent first step.

Is there a catch? Nope. Just shoot me an email at keyboard@scottw.com or @scottw on Twitter, and I will pick someone shortly (shipping on me as well). I would love to see it go to someone who may be just starting down the developer path, but that is not a requirement.

Finally, I would love to see others do something similar. Please hit me at the email above or Twitter if you have something similar you want to make available.
