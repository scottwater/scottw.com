The Peachyuu is based on Kyuu files by Quantrik (with some modifications).

The board was run by [Charue Design](https://charue-design.com/) at cost + small donation to charity.

When I ordered it, I was not sure what to expect. I had always been curious about the Kyuu, but no where near enough to spend $2K+ on the aftermarket.

Some quick points:

- Peachyuu is a top mount board with the plate sandwiched about 3/4 of the way with the outside of the case. The mount leads to a very firm typing experience and leaves few options for custom plates. I like the crispness of typing on a firm board but do not enjoy the feel on a long day of work. I will experiment with the plate file and see if I can make a 1/2 or 3/4 plate that minimizes the number of keys surrounded by metal.
- The color of the case, especially the top is superb.
- I do wish it was WKL. :)
- Zykos are well, Zykos. No blood this time, but I did experience the typical finger nail cracking.
- If I can snag some GMK Copper extras, I might try and patina the copper badge to match.
