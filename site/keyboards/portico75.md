Quick Disclaimer: [TheKey.company](https://thekey.company/) sent me this keyboard for free to review. I was given permission to give it away once the review is complete, so please check out [ThocStock](https://thocstock.com) for the giveaway details.

**Short Answer**: The Portico 75 packs a lot of value into its $139 price point. I typically do not use keyboards with an F-row[^frow], so this is not a keyboard I would personally purchase/keep. However, if the layout works for you, for well under $250, you can have yourself a keyboard that feels and sounds quite nice.

## More details and thoughts on the Portico 75

- 75% layout with an 'exploded' arrow cluster + rotary knob. The most obvious hype comparison is the Satisfaction 75.
- Like the f-row, the knob is lost on me. I have keyboard shortcuts I put in place on all my boards for volume. If this were my only keyboard, I could see myself getting used to the knob (which also has a nice feel).
- The keyboard is made of clear plastic and has per-key RGB and RGB underglow. Per key is not something you will get much use of with a good set of custom keycaps. The underglow is always a nice touch on a clear case. Easy to turn on and adds a nice desk effect.
- The kit came with a large silicone dampener for the bottom of the case and felt to place between the plate and PCB. My initial test was with both in place; however, for long term use, I recommend experimenting until you find a sound and feel you enjoy most.
- A travel case, cable, screwdriver, and more are a nice touch at this price point.
- My kit came with gaskets installed as well as an extra set. If this is how it ships to everyone, that is very welcomed. Clear cases with gaskets can look sloppy if the gaskets are not applied well, so having this set up correctly from the factory is excellent.
- Hotswap and proprietary PCBs always scare me a bit. They are super convenient to set up and offer a lot of flexibility until something goes wrong. This is further complicated on the Portico75 by the using non-standard daughterboard[^daughter].

- Slightly off-topic, but this is my first time using JTK keycaps. I am digging the keycaps and will likely pick up my own set of [JTK Night Sakura](https://thekey.company/products/jtk-night-sakura-keycaps) if I am fast enough for the extras drop. My only gripe with them is the nubs on `F` and `J` are small compared to GMK. Color/texture/feel are all top-notch to me (and of course, you get a plastic case for the keycaps).

[^frow]: Of all the keyboards I currently own, zero have an f-row
[^daughter]: Typically, most mechanical keyboards use the unified open source daughterboard by aio3. This daughterboard is widely available.
