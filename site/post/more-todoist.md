It could just be [that using Todoist](https://scottw.com/mini-todo-list-showdown) is new and shiny for me....but I am more than pleasantly surprised by how handy it is to have a keyboard short cut that can be used to throw random tasks/ideas into a bucket as they pop into my mind.

Hopefully it doesn't wear off anytime soon.
