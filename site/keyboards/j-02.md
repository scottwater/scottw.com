The J-02 has changed my outlook on what a mechanical keyboard can be. It is eerily simple and elegant at the same time.

I usually cycle through keyboards daily, but this has been on my desk since I built it.

Some interesting parts of this board:

- The case is comprised of two pieces of aluminum (top and bottom) and has a solid brass middle.
- The gaskets essentially suspend the plate and PCB in the air. They do take a bit of work to get installed correctly, but the result is worth it.
- There is an "acoustic chamber" at the bottom of the case. According to Jae (designer), there were many revisions to get the best results.
- I have tried a handful of carbon fiber plates. This has the best tolerances by far. They are as perfect as I have experienced.
- Dope pen rail

To get the full build details, I would recommend checking [Jae's build stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUkWe2VP74I).

If you can snag an extra (or stomach the aftermarket prices), you will not be disappointed.

Now the wait for my J-01 Rev 1 begins. :)
