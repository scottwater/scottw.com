# What am I up to now?

My primary activity/responsibility â€“ Raising two great daughters with my fantastic wife.

During _business_ hours, I am the co-founder of [KickoffLabs](https://kickofflabs.com). I focus primarily on the software development side if the business.

At KickoffLabs I am working on:

- E-commerce referrals/rewards (mostly Shopify at this point)
- Working on KickoffLabs on your own site
- Simplifying how we manage the product

Outside of Family and KickoffLabs:

- Writing more (I hope!)
- Building and experimenting with various mechanical keyboards (ðŸ’²ðŸ’²ðŸ’²ðŸ’²)
- Building [How I VSCode](https://howivscode.com)
- Building a new fun app
- Researching launching custom mechanical keyboards (late fall, at the earliest)
- Prototyping a couple of other product ideas (maybe even the successor or evolution of KickoffLabs itself)
- Doubling down on the <span class="text-2xl uppercase text-frost-blueish bg-polar-night-darkest">boring stack of champions</span> (Rails, Tailwind css, Webpack, Stimulus, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Heroku)
