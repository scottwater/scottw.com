One of the best mini-productivity _hacks_ I recently did was installing [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions).

> Fish-like fast/unobtrusive autosuggestions for zsh.
> It suggests commands as you type, based on command history.

Mixed in with all the [Oh My ZSH](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) goodness....it is pure magic.
